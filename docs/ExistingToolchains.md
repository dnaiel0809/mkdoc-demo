# Deep Dive: Migrating Existing Toolchains to StarkNet

When developing for StarkNet, certain specialized components must be rewritten or adapted from existing EVM-compatible versions. These include crucial modules such as:

- **Semaphore Verifier**  
- **Groth16 Verifier Contract**  
- **World ID Contract**  

Each of these components plays a vital role in enabling privacy-preserving identity solutions and bridging functionalities. Migrating them into Cairo requires careful consideration of StarkNetâ€™s architecture and its programming conventions. This process not only highlights the technical hurdles involved but also showcases the transformative potential of developing robust, privacy-focused DApps on a cutting-edge rollup like StarkNet.
